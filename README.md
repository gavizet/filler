About
-----

>"Filler" is an algorithmic 42 school project. The goal is to introduce us to basic algorithm and to have us manipulate
inputs/outputs.

How does it work ?
-----

The concept is simple: two players gain points by placing on a board, one after the other,
the game piece obtained by the game master (in the form of an executable Ruby program).
The game ends when the game piece cannot be placed anymore.

For more details, you can download the subject [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gavizet/filler/master/subject.pdf) or view it at the root of this project.

Usage
-----

>"./filler_vm -f [map] -p1 [player1.filler] -p2 [player2.filler]". You will find pre-made maps and players in the "res" directory. My champion, situated at the root of the project, is named "gavizet.filler".

* Clone the repository
* Run "make" command
* For exemple ">./filler_vm -f maps/map01 -p1 gavizet.filler -p2 players/superjeannot.filler"
